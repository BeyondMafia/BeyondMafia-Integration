# Role Icon Creation Guide

## Role Icon Specification

- 30px by 40px
- Best to leave ~2px margins around
- Editing software: [piskel (free)](https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite), aseprite (paid)

## Adding Icons to the Repository

**Key Resources**
- [Spritesheet](/react_main/public/images/roles.png)
- [Role css](/react_main/src/css/roles.css)

### Step 1: Add Role Icon to the Spritesheet

Download the [role spritesheet](/react_main/public/images/roles.png).

[**Piskel** (free online editor)](https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite)
- Import spritesheet as a single image
- Paste the sprite in any blank "box"
- You can enable gridlines with Preferences > Grid, but you cannot select 30px x 40px as the grid size.

[**Gimp** (free software download)](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/)
- Can be easier to add icons because it has gridlines.
- `File` > `Open Image`
- `View` > `Show Grid`
- `Image` > `Configure Grid`. Disable aspect ratio (chains), then set horizontal 30px vertical 40x.
- Scroll to 800% zoom (see the zoom value at the bottom dock)
- Export the new spritesheet. `File` > `Overwrite roles.png`.

### Step 2: Setup (one-time)

1. Create an account on [Github](https://github.com), which you can think of like a GoogleDrive for code.

2. Go to [rend/BeyondMafia](https://github.com/r3ndd/BeyondMafia-Integration).

3. At the top right, click "Fork" to create your personal copy of BeyondMafia, e.g. `Giga/BeyondMafia`.

4. Go to your fork's webpage, which should be `https://github.com/<your_username>/BeyondMafia-Integration`.

5. Create codespace on your fork.

How it works: you will make edits to your personal repository, and then make a request for your changes to be accepted into the master copy.

### Step 4: Syncing your repository

Sometimes, you might have made some previous changes. This step is important to prevent git conflicts.

1. Open the terminal. `Navigation` > `View` > `Terminal`, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd>.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24848927/220955920-6791c482-10cb-489c-8a85-ad3ebf5ccd7e.png" alt="open terminal" width="300"/>

2. Stash away your previous changes.

```
git stash
```

3. Return to the master branch.

```
git checkout master
```

4. Get the latest update from the `rend/BeyondMafia`'s master branch.

```
git pull upstream master
```

5. Create a new branch (i.e. code workspace) for your role. To avoid dealing conflicts, use a new branch name each time.

```
git checkout -b add-mafioso-icon
```

### Step 5: Make Code Changes

#### Spritesheet

- Navigate to `react_main/public/images/roles.png`
- Drag and drop the new spritesheet in, selecting "replace image".

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24848927/220945605-ab4b5e07-c0d1-4128-ad7f-0b5dac2fff34.png" alt="drag image" width="700"/>

#### Role CSS

- Navigate to `/react_main/src/css/roles.css`
- Each role has its own css defined, such as the ones below:
- The two numbers represent the role's offset on the spritesheet, \[`horizontal_offset`, `vertical offset`\].

```
.role-Mafia-Mayor {
    background-position: -60px -40px;
}

.role-Mafia-Mason {
    background-position: -90px -40px;
}
```

**Determining the offset of your role icon**
- Horizontal offset: Starts at `0px`, then `-30px`, `-60px`... incrementing by `-30px` each time. Must be a multiple of 30.
- Vertical offset: Starts at `0px`, then `-40px`, `-80px`... incrementing by `-40px` each time. Must be a multiple of 40.
- Tip: If you are lazy to calculate, find another role on the same row (`horizontal_offset`) and column(`vertical_offset`) as your icon.

Extra info: What do offsets mean? You can imagine a frame on the first `30px` by `40px` of the spritesheet. E.g. Mayor has offset \[`-60px`, `-40px` \]. This means you would move the image left by `60px`, i.e. two horizontal frames. You would also move the image up by `40px`, i.e. one vertical frame. These actions would position your icon in the reference frame.
 
**Adding role css**
- Within each alignment, rows are sorted by their vertical offset. All the `0px` ones are put first, then `-40px` and so on.
- Create a new css class for your role.
- Note the position of where you add the css. Roles are sorted by alignment, `Village` > `Mafia` > `Independent` > `Monsters`. Within each alignment, roles are sorted by the **row** in which they appear.

```
.role-Mafia-<RoleName> {
    background-position: -30(horizontal)px -40(vertical)px;
}
```

### Step 6: Git commands to "upload" the code to Github

1. Check the changes made. You should be on your role branch, with only two files modified - the spritesheet and the role css.

```
git status
```

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24848927/220961194-1a0a2b02-3e83-4d47-b495-d3c09e54055d.png" alt="git status example" width="700"/>

You can also type this command to double check the changes to the role css. It will show you which lines have been added or modified.

```
git diff react_main/src/css/roles.css
```

2. Confirm your changes by committing.

```
git commit -a -m "added sorceror icon"
```

The confirmatory message will be like this:

```
[add-example-icon abcde12] added example icon
 2 files changed, 4 insertions(+)
```

3. Upload your code to Github (also known as "remote"). The branch name is what you see beside `abcde12` in the previous confirmatory message. Note that your copy won't be exactly `abcde12`

```
git push origin add-example-icon
```

### Step 7: Creating a Pull Request

The changes have been committed to your personal fork, e.g. `Giga/BeyondMafia`. The site is running on a shared master copy, `rend/BeyondMafia`.

1. Go to [rend/BeyondMafia](https://github.com/r3ndd/BeyondMafia-Integration/pulls).

2. You might see a message prompting you to create a pull request.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24848927/220965490-6b2c19f8-4175-4e09-882c-9b8a986760d4.png" alt="compare and pull" width="700"/>

Click `Compare & pull request` if you can, then you can skip Step 3.

3. If you do not see that automated message, click `New Pull Request`. Select "compare across forks". Find your repository in the red box, and find your branch name in the blue box.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24848927/220970441-b62ffb11-7ee2-4332-b5f9-a30814644fee.png" alt="compare across forks" width="700"/>

4. (Optional) Add your ign or any details in the description. You can also drag and drop the role icon sprites in for easier viewing.

5. Set the Pull Request title to `assets(role icon): added icon for XXXXX`

6. Click `Create Pull Request`, ensuring that it does not say "draft".

7. Your pull request (PR) will appear [here](https://github.com/r3ndd/BeyondMafia-Integration/pulls), and it will soon be reviewed.

### Step 8: Closing Codespace

Disclaimer: Every Github user has an allocated amount of Codespace usage each month. **If you are just developing role icons, you can skip this step**. However, if you run any other processes like containers in the background, then this step is important.

Once you have submitted your pull request, go back to your fork's webpage, i.e. `https://github.com/<your_username>/BeyondMafia-Integration`.

You can shutdown (can turn back on) or delete (need to recreate) the codespace.

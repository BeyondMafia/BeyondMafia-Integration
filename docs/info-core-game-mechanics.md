Note on `unique` meetings:
- For group meetings this means the player will not join an existing group.
- For solo meetings this means the player will create a new instance of the meeting even if they’re in one with the same name.
- Default is to not do anything if player has already joined a meeting with the same name or join an existing group if it exists.
- Cannot be unique and `whileAlive` and `whileDead`.

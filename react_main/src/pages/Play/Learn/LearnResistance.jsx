					<div className="paragraph">
						Based on the card game <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance" target="_blank">The Resistance</a> by Don Eskridge.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						In Resistance, a group of rebels is trying to overthrow the government by completing a series of missions.
						However, the government has caught word of the plan and has recruited spies to inflitrate the resistance and sabotage the missions.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						At the beginning of each mission a player is selected as the leader and must recruit several group members to the team.
						All players vote on the selected team and if the majority approve then the mission will proceed. Otherwise, a new leader is chosen to make a new team.
						If several leaders are unable to form a team then that mission automatically fails.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						During a mission the members of the teams who are spies can choose to either make the mission succeed or fail.
						If at least one team member opts for it to fail then the entire mission will fail, otherwise it will succeed.
						The game continues until a certain number of missions succeed or fail, with the Resistance and the Spies winning respectively.

						One Night is a game of logical deduction similar to Mafia, but with only one Night and one Day phase.

					<div className="paragraph">
						The Village side must kill one of the Werewolves to win, and Werewolves must kill one of the village.
						The one night is typically eventful; the role you are given at the beginning of the night may not be the card you end up with.
						Actions will all take place at once at the end of the night. The order of events is given by times in the role descriptions.
